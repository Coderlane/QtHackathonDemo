QtHackathonDemo
===============

A few quick Qt Demos so you can get a feel for the langauage.
You can find more demos here:
* http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtdoc/index.html
* http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/demos.html


## Installation

Make sure you have qtcreator installed!

* On Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install qtcreator
```
* On Windows:
  * Goto: http://qt-project.org/downloads
  * I use the mingw version because I am generally cross compiling.
  * There are more instructions here http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtdoc/install-win.html
