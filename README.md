QtHackathonDemo
===============

Some small demo projects showing what you can do with Qt.

## Installation

Make sure you have qtcreator installed!

* On Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install qtcreator
```
* On Windows:
  * Goto: http://qt-project.org/downloads
  * I use the mingw version because I am generally cross compiling.
  * There are more instructions here http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtdoc/install-win.html
  
clone the repository or click the link to download it!

      git clone https://github.com/TLane/QtHackathonDemo.git
